# RAiD Profile

This repository contains a _profile_ - a standard that inherits from, and constrains/extends, other standards - designed to characterise the registration and extended metadata for Research Activity Identifiers (RAiDs).

See <https://www.raid.org.au/> for more information about RAiDs.

See <https://w3id.org/ardc/def/raid> (not operable yet!) for the profile's online presence.
